<!--The key thing to note on this one is the classes that is assigned to many elements.
	Notice how some elements have multiple classes due to the classes being separated by a space between.
	EX: class being equal to 'row banner' has 2 classes: row and banner.
	Assigning classes is how bootstrap knows how and what to format,
	so make sure that you assign the correct classes to the correct elements.
